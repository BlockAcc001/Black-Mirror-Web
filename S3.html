                <h1>Balck Mirror | Season 03</h1><br>
                <p>The third season of Black Mirror includes the episode “Nosedive”, a brilliant satire on our obsession with social media validation. The episode presents a dystopian society where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, impacting their socioeconomic status. This season marks a shift in the series from purely dark narratives to more nuanced explorations of technology’s impact on society. However, some may argue that this shift has led to a dilution of the series’ original premise.
