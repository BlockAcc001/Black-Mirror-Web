                <h1>Balck Mirror | Season 04</h1><br>
                <p>Season 4 of Black Mirror features diverse narratives, from the space opera “USS Callister” to the romantic “Hang the DJ”. This season showcases the series’ ability to genre-hop while still maintaining its core theme of technology’s impact on society. However, the season’s ambition sometimes outstrips its execution, with some episodes feeling more like concept-driven exercises than fully realized narratives.
