                    <h1>About Black Mirror</h1>
                    <p><b>Black Mirror</b>is a critically acclaimed British anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. The series explores a group of standalone dramas - sharp, suspenseful, satirical tales that explore techno-paranoia. It is a contemporary reworking of “The Twilight Zone” with stories that tap into the collective unease about the modern world.
