                <h1>Balck Mirror | Season 06</h1><br>
                <p>The sixth season of Black Mirror continues to tell grim satirical stories about society. The first episode, “Joan is Awful”, revolves around a woman named Joan who discovers that a streaming service is using her life as a drama series. This meta-commentary on the nature of storytelling and the commodification of personal experiences is a clever twist. However, the season as a whole lacks the punch of earlier seasons, with some episodes feeling more like retreads of old ideas than fresh explorations.

                        <b>Joan is Awful:</b> The first episode, “Joan is Awful”, follows Joan, a woman who feels like she’s not in control of her own life. She works in middle management for a big corporation and has a loving yet fairly boring fiancé. One day, she discovers a show on a streaming service called Streamberry that is using her life as a drama series. The main character, Joan, is played by Salma Hayek, but she’s wearing Joan’s clothing and has the same hairstyle as her. Joan realizes that the show is almost an exact recreation of her day, except it makes her look like a horrible person.

                        <b>Loch Henry:</b> The second episode, “Loch Henry”, follows Davis, a young documentary filmmaker and student who returns to his sleepy hometown of Loch Henry in Scotland3. His girlfriend, Pia, accompanies Davis to his hometown, where she is introduced to Davis’ mom, Janet4. At his childhood home, Davis shares how he and his family enjoyed watching an old detective show. However, his mother was deeply devastated when his father, Kenneth, a police officer, died when Davis was very young.

                        <b>Beyond the Sea:</b> The third episode, “Beyond the Sea”, is set in an alternate history 1969, and follows two astronauts, Cliff (Aaron Paul) and David (Josh Hartnett), who inhabit replicas of their bodies on Earth5. After David’s family are killed on Earth, he begins to use Cliff’s replica and grows closer to Cliff’s wife Lana (Kate Mara).

                        <b>Mazey Day:</b> The fourth episode, “Mazey Day”, introduces us to Bo, a journalist who unknowingly causes a celebrity named Justin Camley to take his own life, after she takes revealing photos of him. Bo realizes the negative impact of the paparazzi industry she’s a part of. As she goes out at night, she witnesses how intrusive and unpleasant her fellow paparazzi can be.

                        <b>Demon 79:</b> The final episode, “Demon 79”, follows the story of a meek sales assistant who is frustrated with the people around her but can only hurt them in her fantasies. This is until she finds out that she has to start hurting people in real life if she wants to save the world. This is a complete role reversal for her as she is forced to leave her moral high ground and become one of the people she detests.
