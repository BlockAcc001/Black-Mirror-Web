                <h1>Balck Mirror | Season 01</h1><br>
                <p>The inaugural season of Black Mirror sets the tone for the series, exploring the dark side of life and technology. The three episodes in this season are distinct yet tied together by a common thread - the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. The first episode, “The National Anthem”, is particularly noteworthy for its audacious plot involving a British royal family member’s kidnapping. The season’s exploration of such bold themes is commendable, although at times it feels like it’s trying too hard to shock the audience.

                        <b>The National Anthem:</b> The first episode, “The National Anthem”, revolves around a shocking dilemma faced by Prime Minister Michael Callow. A beloved member of the Royal Family, Princess Susannah, is kidnapped and the kidnapper demands that the Prime Minister perform an unspeakable act on live television for her safe return. This episode explores the power of social media and public sentiment in shaping political decisions.

                        <b>Fifteen Million Merits:</b> The second episode, “Fifteen Million Merits”, is set in a dystopian future where people earn credits or “merits” by riding stationary bikes. The merits serve as a substitute for currency, allowing people to purchase items such as toothpaste or food. The episode follows Bingham “Bing” Madsen, who encourages a woman named Abi to participate in a talent show in hopes of escaping the monotonous life of cycling.

                        <b>The Entire History of You:</b> The third episode, “The Entire History of You”, is set in a future where a “grain” technology records people’s audiovisual senses, allowing a person to re-watch their memories. The episode follows a man named Liam who becomes suspicious of his wife’s relationship with a friend after a dinner party. His obsession with scrutinizing his memories and his wife’s claims about her relationship leads to a tragic end.
